# Sharingapp (for finals/module4)

You should be able to compile and run this AFTER you implement Contact.java and ContactList.java. This is for Option 1 in assignment instructions: "starter code base  (only have to follow steps 1, 18, 19, and 20 of the tutorial)". 

Tested with
- Android Studio Ladybug | 2024.2.1 Patch 3
- Windows 11

Project configuration
- Android compileSdk 34, minSdk 29, targetSdk 33
- gradle 8.9

I am using Windows so I don't know if it can run right away on other platforms. If Android Studio prompts you to fix something, just press yes and things should be good.

Hope this can help!
